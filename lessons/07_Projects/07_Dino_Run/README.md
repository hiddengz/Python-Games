# Dino Run

![example](images/example.png)

Here are the general rules for **Dino Run**, commonly referring to the **Google
Chrome Dino Game**, where the player controls a dinosaur running through a
desert, jumping over obstacles.


Play the game [here](https://trex-runner.com).

## Objective

The goal of **Dino Run** is to survive as long as possible by avoiding obstacles
(like cacti and flying pterodactyls) while the dinosaur automatically runs
across the screen. The game ends when the dinosaur hits an obstacle, and the
player's score is based on how far they managed to run.

## Gameplay

1. **The Dino**:
   - The player controls a small dinosaur (usually a T-Rex) that automatically
     runs from left to right across the screen.
   - The speed of the dinosaur increases as the game progresses, making it
     harder to avoid obstacles.
   - The only actions the player controls are jumping and ducking.

2. **Obstacles**:
   - **Cacti**: These are stationary obstacles that appear at random intervals.
     The player must jump over them to avoid crashing.
   - **Pterodactyls**: These are flying obstacles that appear later in the game.
     They fly at different heights, and the player must either jump over or duck
     under them, depending on their altitude.

3. **Day/Night Cycle**:
   - As the game progresses, the background changes between day and night. The
     night mode introduces a darker theme, which can make obstacles harder to
     spot.

4. **Increasing Difficulty**:
   - The game's speed increases over time, making it harder to react to
     obstacles.
   - More challenging combinations of obstacles appear as the player’s score
     increases (e.g., closely spaced cacti or pterodactyls flying at tricky
     heights).

## Controls

- **Jump**: Press the spacebar to make the
  dinosaur jump over obstacles like cacti.
- **Duck**: Press the down arrow key to make the
  dinosaur duck, which is useful for avoiding flying obstacles like
  pterodactyls.
  
## Rules

1. **Avoid Obstacles**:
   - The main rule is to avoid colliding with any obstacles. The game ends
     immediately if the dinosaur crashes into a cactus or a pterodactyl.
   - The player can jump over cacti and either jump over or duck under
     pterodactyls.

2. **Increasing Speed**:
   - The dinosaur's running speed increases steadily as time passes, making
     obstacles harder to avoid and requiring faster reflexes.
   
3. **Endless Running**:
   - The game is endless, meaning the goal is to survive as long as possible.
     There is no final level or endpoint—players aim to achieve the highest
     score they can before crashing.

4. **Scoring**:
   - The player's score increases as the dinosaur continues to run. The longer
     the dinosaur survives, the higher the score.
   - There are no bonuses for special moves, only distance covered.
   
5. **High Score**:
   - The game records the player's high score and displays it after each run,
     encouraging players to beat their personal best.

## Winning & Losing

- **Winning**: There is no formal "win" in Dino Run, as the game is endless. The
  goal is to achieve the highest score possible by surviving as long as you can.
- **Losing**: The game ends when the dinosaur crashes into an obstacle, and the
  player’s score is displayed.

## Progressive Difficulty

- **Speed**: As the game progresses, the dinosaur’s speed increases, requiring
  quicker reactions.
- **Obstacle Variations**: Obstacles appear in more difficult patterns, and the
  player will need to time jumps and ducks more precisely.
